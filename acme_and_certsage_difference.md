**acme.sh** is a lightweight shell script for issuing SSL/TLS certificates using the ACME protocol, primarily from Let's Encrypt and other ACME-compatible CAs.

**CertSage** is a newer ACME client focused on modern, secure, and minimal design, written in Go, with better default security practices and simpler configuration.

**Key differences:**
- **Interface:** acme.sh is CLI-only; CertSage includes a web-based GUI.
- **Language:** acme.sh is written in shell script; CertSage is written in Go.
- **Maturity:** acme.sh is older and widely adopted; CertSage is newer and less widely used.
- **Focus:** acme.sh emphasizes wide compatibility and flexibility; CertSage emphasizes simplicity and strong defaults.
